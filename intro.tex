One dimensional Gross--Pitaevskii equation (describes ``cigar-shaped'' condensate) takes form:
\begin{equation}
	i \Psi_t + \Psi_{xx} + U(x) \Psi + P(x) |\Psi|^2 \Psi = 0.
\label{eq:gross-pitaevskii}
\end{equation}

Here $\Psi(t, x)$ is the macroscopic wave function of the condensate, $U(x)$ corresponds to the potential of the trap holding the condensate, and $P(x)$ describes characteristic length of the atomic interactions.
Function $P(x)$ is called as {\it pseudopotential} which is induced by spatial periodic modulation.
This can be achieved in BEC by means of the Feshbach resonance controlled by magnetic or optical field \cite{PollackDriesJunkerChenCorcovilosHulet, ChinGrimmJulienneTsienga, BauerLetterVoRempeDurr}.
In the nonlinear optics spatial modulation of the Kerr coefficient can be induced by inhomogeneous density of resonant nonlinearity-enhancing dopants implanted into the waveguide \cite{HukriedeRundeKip}.
