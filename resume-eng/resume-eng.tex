\nsection{General Description of the Work}

\textbf{Introduction.}
Since the 90s of the last century, the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLS) with additional spatial non-autonomous terms has been an object of thorough studies.
Specific interest to this class of equations has been caused by progress in experimental study of Bose--Einstein Condensate (BEC).
Being predicted in 20-ies\footnote{A. Einstein, ``Quantentheorie des einatomigen idealen Gases'', Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin, 1924.}, this state of matter was obtained for the first time in 1995 independently in experiments of two groups of researchers\footnote{M. H. Anderson, J. R. Ensher, M. R. Matthews, C. E. Wieman, E. A. Cornell, ``Observation of Bose–Einstein Condensation in a Dilute Atomic Vapor'', Science, Vol. 269, P. 198--201, 1995.}.
In 2001 authors of this discovery was awarded the Nobel Prize.

The observation of BEC stimulated experimental and theoretical studies all over the world.
These studies exhibited that BEC may have numerous practical applications.
Nowadays, it's expected that the usage of BEC may have a huge impact on the development of the new high-frequency interferometers\footnote{C. Gross, T. Zibold, E. Nicklas, J. Esteve, and M. K. Oberthaler, ``Nonlinear atom interferometer surpasses classical precision limit'', Nature, Vol. 464, P. 1165--1169, 2010.}.
Also it is expected that BEC can be used in designing of quantum computers\footnote{D. Jaksch, P. Zoller, ``The cold atom Hubbard toolbox'', Annals of Physics, Vol. 315, P. 52--79, 2005.}, and quantum lasers\footnote{W. Guerin, J.-F. Riou, J. P. Gaebler, V. Josse, P. Bouyer, and A. Aspect, ``Guided Quasicontinuous Atom Laser'', Phys. Rev. Lett., Vol. 97, P. 200402, 2006.}.

It turn out that the dynamics of elongated BEC in so-called mean-field approximation is well described by the Schr\"odinger type equation with spatial non-autonomous terms,
\begin{equation}
	i \Psi_t + \Psi_{xx} - U(x) \Psi + P(x) |\Psi^2| \Psi = 0.
\label{eq:gpe}
\end{equation}
In the context of BEC, equation \eqref{eq:gpe} is called the {\it Gross--Pitaevskii equation} (GPE).
Here $\Psi(t, x)$ is the dimensionless wave function of the condensate cloud, that is assumed to be elongated along the axis $x$.
The function $U(x)$ describes the trap potential that is used to confine BEC, and $P(x)$ corresponds to nonlinear potential (also called {\it pseudopotential}).
The pseudopotential describes the dependence of scattering length on the coordinates that may be non-constant due to various reasons.
Possible experimental techniques to achieve non-constant scattering length involves optical or magnetic Feshbach resonances\footnote{C. Chin, R. Grimm, P. Julienne, and E. Tiesinga, ``Feshbach resonances in ultracold gases'', Rev. Mod. Phys. Vol. 82, P. 1225, 2010.}.
Intervals with positive values of pseudopotential, $P(x) > 0$, correspond to the case of attraction of the condensate particles, while intervals with negative values, $P(x) < 0$, correspond to the interatomic repulsion.
The prototypical examples of $U(x)$ are the harmonic potential well $U(x) = Ax^2$ (the magnetic trap), periodic potential $U(x) = A \cos 2x$ (the optical trap), and various types of potential wells.
%
As examples of the pseudopotential $P(x)$, different functions has been used, including periodic ones.
In the latter case one says that there exists a {\it nonlinear lattice} interacting with the condensate cloud.
In physical experiments nonlinear lattice is created by a resonant action of external magnetic\footnote{S. Inouye, M. R. Andrews, J. Stenger, H.-J. Miesner, D. M. Stamper-Kurn \& W. Ketterle, ``Observation of Feshbach resonances in a Bose--Einstein condensate'', Nature, Vol. 392, P. 151-154, 1998.} or optical\footnote{L. W. Clark, Li-Chung Ha, Chen-Yu Xu, and Cheng Chin, ``Quantum Dynamics with Spatiotemporal Control of Interactions in a Stable Bose--Einstein Condensate'', Phys. Rev. Lett., Vol. 115, P. 155301, 2015.} field.
The presence of nonlinear lattice may provide additional possibilities for stabilization of the condensate cloud and for exciting new condensate states.
In order to model a nonlinear lattice in theoretical works the cosine pseudopotential of the form $P(x) = A + B \cos \Omega x$ is traditionally used\footnote{\label{note:malomed} H. Sakaguchi,  B. A. Malomed, ``Matter-wave solitons in nonlinear optical lat­tices'', Phys. Rev. E, Vol. 72, P. 046610, 2005.}.

It's also worth noting that similar problems arise in other branches of physics, in particular in nonlinear optics\footnote{\label{note:turner} Y. V. Kartashov, B. A. Malomed, and L. Torner, ``Solitons in nonlinear lattices'', Rev. Mod. Phys. Vol. 83, P. 247, 2011}.
In various optical applications, equation \eqref{eq:gpe} describes the propagation of a light beam in an optical fiber.
In this case, periodic spatial modulation of nonlinearity is achieved by adding resonant dopants into the fiber\footnote{J. Hukriede, D. Runde, and D. Kip, ``Fabrication and application of holographic Bragg gratings in lithium niobate channel waveguides'', J. Phys. D, Vol. 36, R1, 2003.}.

For different physical applications the solutions of equation \eqref{eq:gpe} of the special form, so-called {\it stationary localized solutions} ({\it stationary localized modes}, SLMs), play an important role.
Such solutions can be obtained by putting into \eqref{eq:gpe} an ansatz
\begin{equation}
	\Psi(t, x) = u(x) e^{-i \omega t},
\label{eq:ansatz}
\end{equation}
where the function $u(x)$ satisfies the localization conditions of the form:
\begin{equation}
	\lim \limits_{x \to \infty} u(x) = 0.
\label{eq:localization}
\end{equation}
Here $\omega$ is a real parameter that stands for a chemical potential of the condensate.
The profile $u(x)$ of the stationary localized solution is a real-valued function\footnote{G. L. Alfimov, V. V. Konotop, and M. Salerno, ``Matter solitons in Bose--Einstein condensates with optical lattices'', Europhys. Lett., Vol. 58, P. 7--13, 2002}, satisfying the equation
\begin{equation}
	u_{xx} + Q(x) u + P(x) u^3 = 0; \quad Q(x) = \omega - U(x).
\label{eq:stationary}
\end{equation}

It should be noted that not all localized solutions of Eq.~\eqref{eq:stationary} are equally interesting from a physical point of view.
The stability is a critically important property of the localized solutions.
If SLM is unstable, a small perturbation leads to its destruction during the temporal evolution.
Therefore, stable localized solutions are especially valuable from the perspective of physical applications.
So, the analysis of stability is an essential part of the theoretical study of SLMs.

\textbf{Formulation of the problem.}
While studying the dynamics described by equation \eqref{eq:gpe} the following questions naturally arise:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Is it possible to describe {\it completely all} stationary localized solutions of equation \eqref{eq:gpe} that coexist for under given parameters?
	\item How to identify stable solutions among them?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{A survey of the current state of the field.}
It's worth noting that in the majority of works devoted to this topic the problem of finding / describing of {\it all} SLMs has not been raised.
Instead, only specific classes of solutions corresponding to particular physical structures has been described, see the comprehensive review\textsuperscript{\ref{note:turner}}.
At the same time, despite the questions above seem a little bit ``challenging'', the combination of rigorous analytical methods with numerical computations makes it possible to achieve significant progress in this direction.
Let us note some related results.

For equation \eqref{eq:stationary} with potential $U(x)$ of the form of infinite potential well, in the case of repulsive interparticle interactions, $P(x) \equiv -1$, the computational descriptive procedure has been proposed\footnote{\label{note:alfzez} G. L. Alfimov, D. A. Zezyulin, ``Nonlinear modes for the Gross--Pitaevskii equation --- a demonstrative computational approach'', Nonlinearity, Vol. 20, P. 2075--2092, 2007.}.
This procedure provides a computational evidence and can guarantee the complete description of {\it all} bounded solutions of equation for the given set of parameters.
The proposed method was afterwards generalized to systems of several coupled Gross--Pitaevskii equation, in which the corresponding pseudopotential do not depend on the spatial coordinate\footnote{G. L. Alfimov, I. V. Barashenkov, A. P. Fedotov, V. V. Smirnov, D. A. Zezyulin, ``Global search for localised modes in scalar and vector nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger-type equations'', Physica D, Vol. 397, P. 39--53, 2019.}.

It was shown, that for the periodic potential $U(x)$ in the case of repulsive interactions of the condensate particles, $P(x) \equiv -1$, there exist sufficient conditions that allow to exhaustively describe {\it all} bounded solutions of equation \eqref{eq:stationary}.
Moreover, it was shown that under these conditions there exist one-to-one correspondence between the bounded solutions and all possible bi-infinite sequences of symbols of some finite alphabet\footnote{\label{note:alfavr} G. L. Alfimov, A. I. Avramenko, ``Coding of nonlinear states for the Gross--Pitaevskii equation with periodic potential'', Physica D, Vol. 254, P. 29--45, 2013.}.
Such sequences are called {\it codes of solutions}, and the algorithm of assigning of such codes can be called {\it coding of solutions}.
In the above mentioned paper, the verification of the sufficient conditions was performed by means of numerical computations.
Results of this paper were further extended\footnote{G. L. Alfimov, P. P. Kizin, D. A. Zezyulin, ``Gap solitons for the repulsive Gross-Pitaevskii equation with periodic potential: Coding and method for computation'', Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems --- Series B, Vol. 22, P. 1207--1229, 2017.}, specifically: there has been proposed an algorithm that allows to reconstruct numerically the profile of the solution by its symbolic code.

It's also worth to mention the mathematical works of F. Zanolin and co-authors\footnote{Ch. Zanini, F. Zanolin, ``Complex Dynamics in One-Dimensional Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations with Stepwise Potential'', Complexity, Vol. 2018, Article ID 2101482, 2018.}\textsuperscript{,}\footnote{Ch. Zanini, F. Zanolin, ``An Example of Chaos for a Cubic Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation with Periodic Inhomogeneous Nonlinearity'', Advanced Nonlinear Studies, Vol. 12, No. 3, P. 481--499, 2012.}, in which the existence of some types of solutions in related problems is proved.
Such solutions also can be classified by means of methods of nonlinear dynamics.
Authors of these works use an approach that relies on topological argumentation and differs from the one presented in the dissertation.

\textbf{Relevance of the research topic.}
Generalization of the above mentioned results to the case of non-constant pseudopotential, $P(x) \neq \mathrm{const}$, is an important actual problem.
Application of the ``coding approach'' to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with periodic pseudopotential yields  a classification of nonlinear stationary states in BEC in nonlinear lattice.
This classification opens up the possibility of experimental finding of new, previously unknown stable stationary states.

\textbf{Tasks and objectives of the study.}
The main object of the study in the dissertation is the set of stationary solutions of one-dimensional Gross -- Pitaevskii equation \eqref{eq:gpe} with {\it periodic pseudopotential}.
Tasks and objectives of the study can be formulated as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To formulate sufficient conditions that allow to generalize the method of coding of SLMs\textsuperscript{\ref{note:alfavr}} to the case of periodic pseudopotential; to specify the ways of verification of these conditions (analytically or with numerical computations).
	\item To study the set of stationary solutions of equation \eqref{eq:gpe} with periodic pseudopotential in the case when the trapping potential can be neglected, $U(x) \equiv 0$.
	\item For the case of harmonic potential well, $U(x) = A x^2$, to investigate the effect of periodic pseudopotential on the structure of the set of stationary localized solutions and their stability.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{The methods.}
In order to study possible types of SLMs the {\it method of excluding of singular solutions}\textsuperscript{\ref{note:alfavr}} is used.
We call a solution of equation \eqref{eq:stationary} {\it singular} if it goes to infinity at a finite point $x = x_0$ of the real axis, i.e.
\begin{equation}
	\lim \limits_{x \to x_0} u(x) = \infty.
\end{equation}
Obviously, such solutions cannot describe a profile of stationary state, so they should be excluded from the consideration.
The main idea is that under certain conditions, ``the most part'' of solutions of Eq.~\eqref{eq:stationary} are singular.
The set of remaining solutions, called {\it regular}, turns out to be quite ``poor'' and it can be fully described in terms of symbolic dynamics.

In order to compute profiles of localized solutions of equation \eqref{eq:stationary} the shooting method is used involving standard procedures for solving Cauchy problems for ODE.
The obtained solutions are checked for linear stability by solving corresponding eigenvalue problem in the Fourier space (Fourier Collocation Method\footnote{J. Yang, ``Nonlinear Waves in Integrable and Nonintegrable Systems'', Philadelphia: SIAM, 2010.}), and also via simulation of dynamics of \eqref{eq:gpe} with a conservative finite-difference scheme\footnote{V. Trofimov, N. Peskov Comparison of finite-difference schemes for the Gross-Pi­ taevskii equation // Mathematical Modelling and Analysis. — 2009. — Mar. — Vol. 14. — P. 109–126.}.
All the algorithms and numerical methods are implemented in {\tt MATLAB} using {\tt MEX} extension for high performance computing support.

\textbf{Scientific novelty.}
In the thesis, a number of exact statements about regular and singular solutions of equation \eqref{eq:stationary} are proved.
The conditions that ensure the existence of singular solutions, or their absence are formulated.
In particular, it was shown that if the pseudopotential is negative at least at one point $x_0$, $P(x_0) < 0$, then there exist two one-parametric families of solutions which tend to infinity at this point $x_0$.
Asymptotic expansions for these families are given.

The method of excluding of singular solutions was further developed.
The dissertation proposes sufficient conditions for existence of one-to-one correspondence between regular solutions of equation \eqref{eq:stationary} and bi-infinite symbolic sequences over some alphabet. 
In contrast to the previously obtained results\textsuperscript{\ref{note:alfavr}}, the proposed conditions admit effective numerical verification.
An algorithm of the numerical verification is provided in the dissertation along with its theoretical justification.

For the case $U(x) \equiv 0$ and cosine periodic pseudopotential of the form $P(x) = A + B \cos 2x$ the set of stationary localized solutions has been studied.
When applying the above-mentioned techniques, the set of SLMs was effectively described, and, eventually, new stable localized solution, named {\it dipole soliton} \cite{LebedevAlfimovMalomed}, was found.
This solution has been previously unknown.

Finally, in the case of harmonic trapping potential, $U(x) = A x^2$, the effect of periodic pseudopotential of the form $P(x) = A + B \cos \Omega x$ on the set of SLMs was studied.
It was shown that in comparison with well-studied case $P(x) = \mathrm{const}$, the set of stationary localized solutions is much richer.
Namely, there exist essentially nonlinear solutions which cannot be predicted by low-amplitude approximation.
The dependence of the SLMs stability on the frequency $\Omega$ of the pseudopotential was studied.
For the pseudopotential with zero mean, $P(x) = B \cos \Omega x$, it was found that the increase of frequency $\Omega$ allows to stabilize low-amplitude solutions, whose counterparts in the model with $P(x) = \mathrm{const}$ are unstable.

\textbf{Confidence level and approbation of the results.}
The Gross -- Pitaevskii model is a classical model of physics of ultra-cold temperatures and its confidence is beyond any doubt.
SLMs in this model correspond to localized stationary solutions of the Gross--Pitaevskii equation.
In the thesis, SLMs are constructed, and their stability is investigated numerically.
Numerical computation of SLMs is performed by means of standard numerical methods for ODEs with controlled accuracy.
The analysis of stability of SLMs is fulfilled by means of the spectral method which is generally recognized for the similar problems.
Results of the stability analysis are verified by solution of the time-dependent Gross--Pitaevskii equation employing a conservative finite-difference scheme.

\nsection{The Content of the Work}

In \textbf{Introduction} the relevance of the dissertation work is justified.
The author formulates the goals of the research and the problems to be solved.
The practical significance of the obtained results is discussed, and the main findings of the thesis are announced.

Also in Introduction the main concepts that are related to the object of study are presented.
{\it Stationary localized solutions} (or {\it stationary localized modes}, SLMs) are defined as solutions of equation \eqref{eq:gpe} of the form \eqref{eq:ansatz} that satisfy the localization conditions \eqref{eq:localization}.
Solutions $u(x)$ of equation \eqref{eq:stationary} is called  {\it singular} if for some finite point $x_0$ the relation $u(x) \to \infty$ as $x \to x_0$ takes place.
Point $x_0$ is called a collapse point for the solution $u(x)$.
Alternatively, one can say that such solution {\it collapses} at the point $x_0$.
On the contrary, solution is called {\it regular} if there is no such point $x_0$.

In \textbf{Chapter I} the propositions about regular and singular solutions of equation \eqref{eq:stationary} are formulated and proved.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:absense-of-singular-solutions}
	Let for equation \eqref{eq:stationary} functions $Q(x), \, P(x) \in C^1(\mathbb{R})$, and for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[(a)] $P(x) \ge P_0 > 0$, $|P'(x)| \le \widetilde{P}$;
		\item[(b)] $Q(x) \ge Q_0$, $|Q'(x)| \le \widetilde{Q}$.
	\end{enumerate}
	Then a solution of the Cauchy problem for equation \eqref{eq:stationary} with arbitrary initial condi­tions can be continued to the whole real axis R.
\end{proposition}

Proposition \ref{prop:absense-of-singular-solutions} establishes the conditions for absence of singular solutions.
One of these conditions requires function $P(x)$ to be positive.
On the other hand, if function $P(x)$ takes a negative value at least at one point $x_0$, $P(x_0) < 0$, then there exist two families of solutions of equation \eqref{eq:stationary} that collapse at this point.
In order to formulate the corresponding statement it's convenient to assume that $P(x_0) = -1$ (it's always can be achieved by a suitable renormalization).

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:singular-families}
	Let $P(x_0) = -1$ and $\Omega$ be a neighbourhood of the point $x_0$, $Q(x) \in C^2(\Omega)$, and $P(x) \in C^4(\Omega)$.
	Then there exist two $C^1$-smooth one-parametric families of solutions for equation \eqref{eq:stationary}, collapsing at the point $x = x_0$ (while approaching from the left, $x \to x_0{-}0$), and connected by a symmetry $u \to -u$.
	Each of these families can be parametrized by a free variable $C \in \mathbb{R}$, and, moreover, the following asymptotic expansions are valid:
	\begin{equation}
		\pm u(x) = \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{\eta} + A_0 + A_1 \eta + A_2 \eta^2 + A_3 \eta^3 \ln |\eta| + C \eta^3+ A_4 \eta^4 \ln |\eta| + \dots.
	\label{eq:expansion}
	\end{equation}
	Here $\eta = x - x_0$, and coefficients $A_n$ can be expressed in terms of coefficients $Q_n$, $P_n$ of the corresponding expansions for the functions $Q(x)$, $P(x)$,
	\begin{equation}
		Q(x) = Q_0 + Q_1 \eta + Q_2 \eta^2 \dots, \quad P(x) = -1 + P_1 \eta + P_2 \eta^2 + \dots.
	\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

Similar one-parametric families of collapsing solutions also exist to the right side of the point $x = x_0$.
Finally, the conditions are given that ensure that equation \eqref{eq:stationary} has no regular non-zero solutions at all.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:all-solutions-are-singular}
 	Let for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ the conditions $P(x) \le P_0 < 0$, $Q(x) \le Q_0 < 0$ take place.
 	Then all solutions of equation \eqref{eq:stationary} are singular except for the zero one.
\end{proposition}

It follows from Proposition~\ref{prop:singular-families} that if pseudopotential $P(x)$ is a sign-altering function then singular behaviour is common for solutions of equation \eqref{eq:stationary}.
This fact makes it possible to apply the method of excluding of singular solutions\textsuperscript{\ref{note:alfavr}}.
Results of the first chapter were published in \cite{AlfimovLebedev} and \cite{Ufa2015}.

In \textbf{Chapter II} the basic concept of the theory for coding of stationary states is introduced.
It is assumed that the potential and the pseudopotential in Eq.~\eqref{eq:gpe} are $L$-periodic functions, $U(x + L) = U(x)$, $P(x + L) = P(x)$.
It turns out that under certain conditions the set of regular solutions of equation \eqref{eq:stationary} can be fully described by the structure of the so-called {\it coding sets}: $\mathscr{U}_L^+$, $\mathscr{U}_L^-$, $\mathscr{U}_L$.
These sets are defined on the plane $(u, u')$ of initial conditions for equation \eqref{eq:stationary} as follows.
The set $\mathscr{U}_L^+$ consists of all initial conditions to the Cauchy problem such that the corresponding solutions are bounded on the interval $[0; L]$.
Similarly, the set $\mathscr{U}_L^-$ consists of such initial conditions that the corresponding solutions are bounded in the interval $[-L; 0]$.
The set $\mathscr{U}_L$ represents an intersection of the two sets above, $\mathscr{U}_L = \mathscr{U}_L^+ \cap \mathscr{U}_L^-$.
The relation between the points of these sets can be described in terms of Poincar\'e map.
It's defined as follows.
Let $\vb{p} \in \mathscr{U}_L^+$, then $\mathcal{P} (\vb{p}) = \vb{q} = (u(L), u'(L))$, $\vb{q} \in \mathscr{U}_L^-$ where $u(x)$ is a solution of Cauchy problem for equation \eqref{eq:stationary} with initial conditions $u(0) = u_0$, $u'(0) = u_0'$.
The sequence of points $\{ \vb{p}_n \}$ constructed by iterating the Poincar\'e map is called an {\it orbit}.

The approach is based on {\it two hypotheses} about the action of the map $\mathcal{P}$ on the set $\mathscr{U}_L$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(I)] The set $\mathscr{U}_L$ is a union of finite or infinite number of connected components, $\mathscr{U}_L = \bigcup_{k \in S} D_k$, where $S$ is a set of indices, and each component $D_k$ is a curvilinear quadrangle with monotonic boundaries.
		Moreover, for any $i, j$, sets $H_{ij} = \mathcal{P}(D_i) \cap D_j$ and $V_{ij} = \mathcal{P}^{-1}(D_j) \cap D_i$ are non-empty.
	\item[(II)] Maps $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{P}^{-1}$ in some way preserve the monotonicity properties of strips, called {\it h- and v-strips}, connecting the opposite sides of $D_k$, and the width of these strips decreases under the action of corresponding maps. 
\end{itemize}
Let's clarify Hypothesis~II.
If it's valid, then the above defined sets $H_{ij}$ and $V_{ij}$ represent h- and v-strips correspondingly.
It follows from Hypothesis~II that the set $\mathcal{P}(H_{ij}) \cap D_k$ is also an h-strip, and $d_{\mathrm{h}}(\mathcal{P}(H_{ij}) \cap D_k) < d_{\mathrm{h}}(H_{ij})$, where $d_{\mathrm{h}}(\cdot)$ is the h-strip width measured along the vertical line.
Similarly, the set $\mathcal{P}^{-1}(V_{ij}) \cap D_k$ represents a v-strip, and $d_{\mathrm{v}}(\mathcal{P}^{-1}(V_{ij}) \cap D_k) < d_{\mathrm{v}}(V_{ij})$.
Here $d_{\mathrm{v}}(\cdot)$ is the v-strip width measured along the horizontal line.

It was shown in this chapter that under Hypotheses~I and II, the action of $\mathcal{P}$ on $\mathscr{U}_L$ is of the Smale horseshoe type\footnote{S. Wiggins, ``Introduction to Applied Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Chaos'', New York: Springer-Verlag, 2003.}, and there exists a one-to-one correspondence between {\it orbits} of regular solutions of equation \eqref{eq:stationary} and {\it bi-infinite sequences} of symbols of some alphabet (the number of symbols is equal to the number of components $D_k$ of the set $\mathscr{U}_L$).
In this part of the study, author follows the approach that goes back to 60-70-es, the works of L.~P.~Shilnikov and V.~M.~Alekseev.
In the seminal papers\footnote{Л. П. Шильников, <<Об одной задаче Пуанкаре-Биркгофа>>, Математический сборник, Т. 74, \textnumero 4, С. 378--397,  1967.}\textsuperscript{,}\footnote{В. М. Алексеев, <<Финальные движения в задаче трех тел и символическая динамика>>, Успехи математических наук, Т. 36, Вып. 4, С. 161, 1981.} the symbolic dynamics approach was applied for description of behaviour of trajectories near a homoclinic loop and for three-body problem.
In this thesis, the horseshoe dynamics approach is used for the mapping of sets $\mathscr{U}_L^{\pm}$ that is a new application of this theory.

% This result remains the prominent works by L. P. Shilnikov\footnote{Л. П. Шильников, <<Об одной задаче Пуанкаре-Биркгофа>>, Математический сборник, Т. 74, \textnumero 4, С. 378--397,  1967.} and V. M. Alekseev\footnote{В. М. Алексеев, <<Финальные движения в задаче трех тел и символическая динамика>>, Успехи математических наук, Т. 36, Вып. 4, С. 161, 1981}.
% In the former case a problem of classification of solutions near the homoclinic curve was considered.
% It was found that the set of solutions that are asymptotic to the homoclinic curve are in correspondence with symbolic codes, which can be constructed in some way.
% In the latter case the similar structure of solution codes was proposed for special classes of solutions of the three-body problem.
% Key difference between the above mentioned works and the current thesis is that the symbolic dynamics approach is applied to the sets $\mathscr{U}_L^{\pm}$.

Verification of the hypotheses is performed numerically.
Hypothesis~I is verified by direct {\it scanning} of properly chosen area of the plane of initial conditions.
Verification of Hypothesis~II requires more sophisticated approach.
In this chapter two theorems (called {\it Theorems on h- and v-strips mapping}) are formulated.
These theorems allow to reduce verification of Hypothesis~II to an effective numerical procedure.
The procedure consists in estimating of some constants at the points $\vb{p}$ belonging to special subsets of the set $\mathscr{U}_L$.
The algorithm is as follows.

\begin{algorithm}[H]

	\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The result of the work of the algorithm above is illustrated (see Figure~\ref{fig:hypotheses-validation}) by the example of equation \eqref{eq:stationary} with $Q(x) \equiv -1$ and $P(x) = \eta(x)$, where $\eta(x)$ is a piecewise constant periodic function of the period $L = L_* + L_0$, defined in a following way:
\begin{equation}
	\eta(x) = \left\{
		\begin{array}{rl}
			-1, & x \in [0; L_*); \\
			+1, & x \in [L_*; L_* + L_0).
		\end{array}
	\right.
\label{eq:eta}
\end{equation}
It turns out (see Proposition~6 in the thesis) that the set $\mathscr{U}_L$ on the plane of initial conditions for such equation is unbounded.
Nevertheless, one can restrict the consideration to some bounded subset $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathscr{U}_L$.
If Hypotheses~I and II are valid for $\mathcal{D}$, then it's possible to describe completely a subset of regular solutions, whose orbits do not leave the considered subset $\mathcal{D}$ on the plane of initial conditions.
In Figure~\ref{fig:hypotheses-validation} example of the set $\mathcal{D}$ is shown.
This set consists of three connected components.
Hypotheses~I and II are valid for $\mathcal{D}$, hence, there exists a subset of regular solutions which can be exhaustively coded with three symbols $\{-1, 0, +1\}$.
Results of the second chapter where published in \cite{Bannoe2019} and \cite{Bannoe2021}.

In \textbf{Chapter III} the set of stationary localized solutions has been studied for the case of equation \eqref{eq:gpe} in which the trapping potential is absent, $U(x) \equiv 0$, and the pseudopotential has a cosine form, $P(x) = A + \cos 2x$.
Such model has been previously considered in literature.
It was reported\textsuperscript{\ref{note:malomed}} that this model admits a stationary localized bell-shaped solution, called {\it fundamental soliton}, which is stable for certain parameters of the equation.

In Chapter~III the coding approach is applied to this model.
Structure of the coding sets is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:island-set}.
In turns out that the sets $\mathscr{U}_{\pi}^{\pm}$ ($L = \pi$) are infinite spirals.
Their intersection $\mathscr{U}_{\pi}$ is unbounded and consists of infinite number of connected components.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[scale = 1]{../pic/island set to check hypotheses for cosine equation}

\label{fig:island-set}
\end{figure}

Verification of Hypotheses~I and II was performed numerically for a subset $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathscr{U}_{\pi}$ consisting of seven central connected components.
The numerical procedure allowed to conclude that both of the hypotheses take place.
Hence, there is a one-to-one correspondence between solutions of equation \eqref{eq:stationary} and symbolic codes derived from the structure of coding set.
Existence of such correspondence allows to conclude that the set of stationary localized solutions of the considered equation is extremely rich.
In Figure~\ref{fig:solutions} different solutions along with their symbolic codes are shown.

Analysis of the linear stability by means of spectral method showed that the majority of solutions are unstable.
However, there is a number of stable solutions, and some of them were previously unknown.
One of these new stable solutions is the so-called {\it dipole soliton}.
Its profile is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:solutions}~(e).
Results of the third chapter were published in \cite{LebedevAlfimovMalomed}, \cite{NizhniNovgorod2016} and \cite{Tashkent2018}.

In \textbf{Chapter IV} the set of SLMs is studied for equation \eqref{eq:gpe} where, along with the periodic pseudopotential, the trapping potential in the form of harmonic potential well is included.
After the suitable renormalization, the functions of potential and pseudopotential take the forms $U(x) = x^2$, $P(x) = A + B \cos \Omega x$.
The equation admits so-called {\it stationary solutions with linear counterpart}.
These solutions arise from small-amplitude limit, $|u(x)| \ll 1$.
In this case one can omit nonlinear part in equation \eqref{eq:stationary} and obtain the harmonic oscillator equation,
\begin{equation}
	u_{xx} + (\omega - x^2) u = 0,
\end{equation}
that is an eigenvalue problem for the values $\omega$.
Its solutions are well-known:
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{\omega}_n = 2n + 1; \quad \tilde{u}_n(x) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2^n n! \sqrt{\pi}}} H_n(x) e^{-\frac{1}{2} x^2}; \quad n = 0, 1, \dots,
\label{eq:ho}
\end{equation}
where functions $H_n(x)$ are Hermite polynomials.
When the nonlinearity is turned on, each eigenvalue $\tilde{\omega}_n$ bifurcates and originates one-parametric family of solutions $\Gamma_n = (\omega_n, u_n(x))$ for the nonlinear problem.
Such families are called families of solutions with linear counterpart. 

It's known\textsuperscript{\ref{note:alfzez}} that solutions with linear counterpart exhaust the set of SLMs for the case $P(x) \equiv -1$.
However, in the case of periodic pseudopotential, there exist solutions without linear counterpart.
In Chapter~IV the branches of such solutions are constructed numerically, see Figure~\ref{fig:branches}.
Linear stability analysis showed that almost all of them are unstable.

The second part of the fourth chapter is devoted to the analysis of the stability for low-amplitude solutions with linear counterpart.
It is shown that in the case of pseudopotential with zero-mean, $P(x) = B \cos \Omega x$, increase of the frequency $\Omega$ leads to stabilization of low-amplitude solutions with linear counterpart.
That is, for each branch $\Gamma_n$ there exists a threshold $\Omega_n$, such that for $\Omega > \Omega_n$ the corresponding branch of solutions is stable in the vicinity of its bifurcation point $N \ll 1$, $\omega_n \approx \tilde{\omega}_n$.
Results of the fourth chapter were published in \cite{AlfimovGegelLebedevMalomedZezyulin} and \cite{Bannoe2018}.
